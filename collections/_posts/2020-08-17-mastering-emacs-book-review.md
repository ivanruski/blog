<br /><br />
The book contains a lot of useful information!<br /><br />The hidden takeaway from the book is to learn how to ask Emacs questions rather than always looking on the web. Another takeaway is that if you want to be an Emacs master you've got to learn Emacs Lisp. (The book doesn't touch that topic)<br /><br />Even though the title of the book is "Mastering Emacs", this book won't make anyone a master (In my opinion). It's intended audiance are people who are new to emacs.
