# You dont have to know everything

  Recently I've started learning emacs. As part of the learning
process I've decided that I will open every file with it in order to
get use to the keybindings. Also I've changed my IDE[^1]
keybindings to be emacs-like in my attempt to learn them faster.

  It worked I got used to the keybindings and I started to enjoy
editing files this way. However this caused me discomfort whenever I
needed to type outside of emacs or my IDE. Under MacOS I wouldn't have
much problems for the basic keybindings which is perfectly fine for
me, but I use windows.

  Luckily there is a software called AutoHotKey which allows you to 
re-map keys and much more. Everytime I was typing in a random text
area and I had pressed the wrong key I was telling my self how I have
to learn AHK and fix this problem. I seemed to never have the time to
do that. ... until today, after I felt that discomfort again.

  Earlier today I said to myself - "That's it. Enough is enough. I
will set up my AHK script and I will continue to live my life
happily". I downloaded AHK, I opened up the documentation and started
looking for way on how to remap my keys so that I will have emacs-like
navigating experience.

  Long story short, it took me awhile but I finally did it. However
instead of moving on with my real tasks I continued to read about AHK
I wanted to understand how does it work and then move on. (The problem
was that I dont know C++[^2] and I doubt that even if I did, I would
have been able to understand how does it work in a reasonable amount 
of time.) I started googling around trying to understand how does it
work - needless to say I failed miserably and I lost few hours falling
down the rabit hole. I realized that too late. I was already unable
to do meaningfull work so I left work and went home[^3].

  I was feeling so miserable. I spent my time trying to understand
something and the end result wasnt there. But I was still thinking
what are the possible implementations. The implementation that sounded
plausible to me was that AHK is standing between the operating system
and the active window. Even if this is somehow true there are several
things I dont know here: 1 - How does the window manager works in
Windows. 2 - What are the ways to intercept the keystrokes sent by the
os and send another to the active windows and so much more.

  So I gave up, I have decided that I will use AHK without knowing how
it works and that when I talk about this software I will ask the
person/people with whom I am talking to about my theory of how it
works.

  Only after I gave up I realized that I dont have to know
everything. I had tasks to do, I wanted to read 'C# in depth' after
work, I wanted to spend some time with my lady before bed. Now I wont
be able to do all these things.

  This is the reason I wrote this. I am hoping that the next time I
fall down that rabit hole again I will remember writing this and I
will manage to prioritize my tasks better.

[^1]: I use Rider(JetBrains) - really cool
[^2]: AHK is open sourced and in GitHub
[^3]: Yes it was that bad - during work
